# Restaurant Management App for Luneil Cafe

My sister and I wanted to collaborate on a project, so we chose to develop a restaurant management system using Node.js that can process orders, track order history and store product details to fulfill the business needs of my momâ€™s small catering business. She is using her own version with the real recipes (because we canâ€™t give away family secrets ðŸ˜‰) but you can checkout the demo version below.

## Next Steps

- [x] Add order status to order history form and allow user to change status as required. 
- [x] Add feature to allow user to input new products to product database through web application. This can only currently be done through accessing the MongoDB database online. 
- [x] The website is currently responsive, but a future goal is to refactor the css using a mobile first design approach to allow website application to be more responsive to different screen sizes and to make code cleaner / dryer.
