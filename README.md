# Restaurant Management App for Luneil Cafe

My sister and I wanted to collaborate on a project, so we chose to developed a restaurant management system using Node.js that can process orders, track order history and store product details to fulfill the business need of my momâ€™s small catering business. She is using her own version with the real recipes (because we canâ€™t give away family secrets ðŸ˜‰) but you can checkout the demo version below.
